# Guess the Flag SwiftUI App
This "Guess the Flag" iOS app was created as part of my learning journey, following along with Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course. The app is designed to test your knowledge of country flags using SwiftUI.

## Overview
The "Guess the Flag" app presents the user with a random flag, and the user has to choose the correct country from a list of options. The app provides an engaging way to learn and recognize different flags from around the world.

## Features
- Randomly displays flags from various countries.
- Presents multiple-choice options for the user to guess the correct country.
- Tracks the user's score and provides feedback on each guess.
- Beautifully designed user interface using SwiftUI.
